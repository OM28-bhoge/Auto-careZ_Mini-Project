## 2 ) Existing System and Need of System : -
There are very few system we found which are implementing for online booking servicing purpose. As we went through www.marutisuzuki.com we didn’t find detailed services with price. Along with registering to that website for booking service purpose a call will be made by them so user has to talk about services on phone whereas in our website customer can easily see newely services long with their prices even after that he has some enquiry to do he can go through contact us. 
We also visited to Kisan tyres named service center where they provide service much more about only tyres also a few service they provide like washing repairing every time user has to go for center by his own and make service. Sometimes a big queue is there and customer has to wait then after servicing the manager keep records to his book. It is very time consuming.
